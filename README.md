## Collaboration Guide

Please consult [this blog
post](https://davidbphd.com/project-organization-for-reproducible-data-science/),
which outlines most aspects of our project organization recommendations.

* [Code style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), with some modifications;
  this will largely be enforcd with [`styler`](https://styler.r-lib.org/).
* Project organization: _mostly_ independent subdirectories, each incorporating
  [`here`](https://here.r-lib.org/) for path resolution.
* Package version control and virtual environments using
  [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/).
* Code review procedure: TBD
